                <h2>What is Graphic Design?</h2>
            <p>
        Graphic design is a form of <strong>visual communication</strong> that combines images, typography, and creative ideas to convey a message. It is a versatile discipline that touches almost every aspect of our daily lives, from advertisements to app interfaces and even product packaging. By leveraging design elements such as color, composition, and imagery, graphic designers can captivate audiences and guide them toward a desired action or understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        At its core, graphic design is about problem-solving. Whether it’s creating a logo that represents a brand's identity, designing a website that improves user experience, or crafting an eye-catching poster for an event, a graphic designer’s role is to turn concepts into engaging visual content that communicates <strong>clearly and effectively</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Graphic design relies on foundational principles, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Ensures elements stand out and grab attention.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Creates a sense of organization and balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Proportion</strong>: Maintains harmony between design elements, making them visually appealing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Graphic design can be divided into different areas, such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Branding and Identity</strong>: Designing logos, business cards, and brand guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising and Marketing</strong>: Creating posters, flyers, and social media graphics.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interface (UI) Design</strong>: Building intuitive interfaces for websites and apps.</li>
    </ol>
